This project is an extension of Project 22. Introducing the API Gateways, and the concept of Load balancing for the Users service and Timelines service of Project2-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FILES SUBMITTEDapp.py: This file includes the micro services for users. This file is modified: The endpoints of api's - contained in this file are updated in this file, so as to validate whether the request is from users service or timelines service.timelines.py: This file includes the micro services for Timelines. This file is modified: Similar to app.py, the endpoints of api's - contained in this file are updated in this file, so as to validate whether the request is from users service or timelines service.gateway.py: This is main file, which acts as a gateway for Users and Timelines services. All the services are routed to Gateway (running on 5000). The main functionality of the gateway is to validate the user and Forwards the requests to the corresponding service. Also its performs round-robin load balancing technique to route the requests.routes.cfg: This file includes the list of urls - ports of both users and timelines services. 3 instances of Users service running on 5100, 5101, 5102 ports and 3 instances of timelines service(running on 5200, 5201, 5202 ports). schema.sql: This file is same as that in Project2. It includes database schema..env: This file is same as that in Project2. But changed one of the variable APP_CONFIG to routes.cfg.So, including this change. This file contains the environmental variables (FLASK_ENV and APP_CONFIG).Procfile: This file enables us to create the instance of gateway, users and timelines services in 3 different ports.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INSTALLATION:1.
